Geometric Shapes Interaction Web Application

Built using React, this project showcases state and props management along with lazy loading. Leveraging React Konva, a JavaScript library that seamlessly integrates React with the Konva Framework, it offers a declarative and reactive approach to drawing complex canvas graphics. Responsive and engaging, this application provides a versatile space for exploring geometric concepts and unleashing creativity.

Project Objective:
The primary goal is to develop a web-based application prototype offering users a creative playground to interact with basic geometric shapes. Users can seamlessly place, select, and modify shapes such as squares, triangles, circles, trapezoids, and lines on a simple grid in the X, Y plane.

Implemented Features:

Simple Grid: Implemented a 2D grid in the X, Y plane. The grid lines dynamically adjust in density based on the zoom level, ensuring clarity and avoiding clutter.
Shape Placement: Users can effortlessly place various shapes onto the grid, including squares, triangles, circles, trapezoids, and lines.
Shape Interaction:
Positioning: Enables users to freely move selected shape(s) across the grid.
Selection and Multi-selection: Users have the flexibility to select a single shape or multiple shapes simultaneously, with visual indicators like highlighting or bounding boxes.
Scaling: Allows users to resize selected shape(s) while maintaining proportions, enhancing customization options.
Rotation: Users can rotate selected shapes around their center point, facilitating versatile manipulation.

Responsive Design:
The application is designed to be responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across various devices and screen sizes.
